## Introduction

Our intern Dan is working on this killer Movie Quotes App that returns a random movie quote. Right now all it does is render a blank screen in the web browser. Fork the repository found here and help Dan fix it. Â 

## Specifications

The finished project:

The steps I took:
- Forked the repo
- Cloned the repo locally
- Discovered that the npm start was not working because the script was missing.  
- Added "start": "node index.js" to scripts in package.json
- Installed the npm package that is missing to run the random movie quotes npm i random-movie-quotes 
- Added this dependency to index.js: const quotes = require("random-movie-quotes");
- Saved the file and run it with npm start
- Opened the browswer to http://localhost:3000/
- Each time we refreshed the browser a new movie quote should show up
- Git add, commit and push the changes to my master branch
